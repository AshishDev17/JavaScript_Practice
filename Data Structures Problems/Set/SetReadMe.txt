What is a Set?
A set is a collection of unique elements. The elements of a set are called members. The two most important properties of sets are that the members of a set are unordered and that no member can occur in a set more than once.

- A set containing no members is called the empty set. The universe is the set of all possible members.
- Two sets are considered equal if they contain exactly the same members.
- A set is considered a subset of another set if all the members of the first set are contained in the second set.

The fundamental operations performed on sets are:
Union
A new set is obtained by combining the members of one set with the members of another set.
Intersection
A new set is obtained by adding all the members of one set that also exist in a second set.
Difference
A new set is obtained by adding all the members of one set except those that also exist in a second set.
