What is Queue?
A queue is a type of list where data are inserted at the end and are removed from the front. Queues are used to store data in the order in which they occur, as opposed to a stack, in which the last piece of data entered is the first element used for processing.
A queue is an example of a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure.
