What is List data structure?

A list is an ordered sequence of data. Each data item stored in a list is called an ele‐ ment. In JavaScript, the elements of a list can be of any data type. There is no predeter‐ mined number of elements that can be stored in a list, though the practical limit will be the amount of memory available to the program using the list.
